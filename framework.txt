Generate Board
  -using 2D vectors make the grid, but I can't color the grids in with alternating color
  -used an array to make the grid, had trouble understanding transforming game object position
  -alternated b/w pieces using (file + rank) % 2; if 0, black; if 1, white
  -in order to index the array, I labeled each square relative to the grid position (i.e. (1,1) --> 9) using the general formula (i,j) = i + 8*j
  -Using an array is more difficult to store images and lock in to a grid; attempting to use a cell structure 
  -I wasn't having difficulty writing the code, using prefabs and learning Unity was challenging
  -Switched to pycharm and python for project
