PIECES CANNOT MOVE IT IS GOING TO CAUSE A CHECK
-Look at all moves
-Filter moves
    -make the move
    -generate all possible moves for opposing players
    -see if there is a check

    -look at king; think about all the lines that can attack the king
    -need to check for pins
    -check knights
    -check double checks
-return list of valid moves

have to debug, it is not reading the if statement self.check
function works; if else self.check DOESNT

bishop and rook are not checking to see if there is an ally piece; adding illegal moves to valid moves
