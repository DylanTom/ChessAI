# ChessAI
ChessAI is an open source chess engine developed by Dylan Tom adapted from the tutorial shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_). Using this chess engine, there will be (1) Player vs. Player, (2) Player vs. Computer, (3) Computer vs. Computer.
Specifically, in (3), I am attempting to implement (i) a greedy heuristic algorithm, (ii) a minmax-alpha-beta pruning algorithm, and (iii) a deep neural network.
